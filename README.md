🎯 Project Objectives

- Practice JavaScript fundamentals
- Manipulate the DOM dynamically
- Implement conditional rendering
- Improve user experience with interactivity

📦 Project Requirements

- Create an array of quote objects (quote, source, optional citation & year)
- Generate a random quote using JavaScript
- Display quotes dynamically in the DOM
- Conditionally render optional properties

⭐ Extra Credit Features

- Display quote tags when available
- Dynamic background color change on each quote refresh 🎨
- Automatic quote refresh every 10 seconds using setInterval() ⏱️

✨ Personal Enhancements

To improve the user experience, I implemented logic to prevent the same quote from appearing twice in a row.
This avoids repetition and creates a smoother interaction for the user.
