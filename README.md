🌐 Random Quote Generator — Treehouse FSJS Techdegree
Unit 01 Project 

This is my first project for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.
The goal was to create a random quote generator using JavaScript, objects, DOM manipulation, and conditional logic.

📦 Project Requirements (Summary)
✔️ Create an array of quote objects
An array of objects storing the quote, the source, and optional properties such as citation and year.

✔️ Create the getRandomQuote() function
Generates a random number to select a quote from the quotes array.

✔️ Create the printQuote() function
Updates the UI by displaying the quote, its source, and the citation and year if they exist.


⭐ Extra Credit Features I Completed
🔹 1. Displayed as an extra <span> for the tag property .
🔹 2. Function changeBackgroundColor() to generate color and update the page background on each quote refresh 🎨
🔹 3. Quotes automatically update every 10 seconds using setInterval() ⏱️


✨ My Personal Touch
My personal addition was implementing logic to make sure the same quote never appears twice in a row 🔁✨.
This improves the user experience and removes visual confusion.
